# Load More
learning load more concept by abdul15irsyad :)

## Installation
1. clone the repo (in terminal or bash) and then install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install all dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdul15irsyad/load-more.git
cd load-more
npm install

```
2. after all the existing dependecies installed then run the application with the `npm start` or `npm run dev` (with nodemon)

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. make a file named `.env` paste mongoDB uri to connect the database (you can also edit `.env.sample` and then rename it to `.env`)

4. open browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), if you didn't change the port in `.env` (if you change the `.env`, you must change the `apiBaseUrl` variable in `./public/js/main.js`)

enjoy :)
